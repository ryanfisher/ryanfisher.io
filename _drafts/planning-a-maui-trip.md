# Planning a Maui Trip

Hawaii! Stacy and I will be taking our first kid-free trip in 4 years to celebrate our 5th anniversary. Kauai and Maui were at the top of our list, and we've decided Maui is the winner. I've documented some of our trip details here. Hopefully you find some of this useful for your next Maui trip!

## Getting There

Flying from San Diego, Alaska Airlines has direct flights into Kahului (OGG). We're lucky to live about as close as possible yet it's still a 6 hour flight.

## Getting Around

It seems a convertible is the way to go if we really want to get the full Road to Hana experience (more on that later). [Turo](https://www.turo.com), a car-sharing service, is a possibility to avoid the pain of traditional rental agencies. There a lot of Mustang convertibles available or maybe a Porsche if we really want to kick it up.

## Where to Stay

Did I mention that this was a kid-free trip?! There is one adults-only resort on Maui and it got our attention. While it's a little on the pricey side, [Hotel Wailea](https://www.hotelwailea.com) feels reasonable for the accomadations, and is still cheaper than many of the comparable, and more family friendly, options. We'll have years of resort stays with kids splashing around in the pool. This time we're deciding to avoid it.

## What to Bring

- Camera
- Reef safe sunscreen
