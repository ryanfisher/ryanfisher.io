# DIY Ecosystem Pond

### Expectations

- Crystal clear water, possibly accomplished with a large bog filter.
- A lot of shelves for planting variety.
- Fish, ideally koi if conditions allow it.
- Some reservoir for rainwater harvesting and to limit how often water needs to be added.
- Simple access to front gate, potentially a bridge over portion of pond.
- Good overflow drainage for winter rain events.
