## Maui Review

### Day one - Road to Hana
Our flight landed about noon. We headed to the rental car center to pick up our convertible camaro, the recommended car for the Road to Hana. From there we immediately headed towards Hana.

Our first stop was [Mana Foods](https://manafoodsmaui.com), a wonderful independent grocery store in Paia. We picked up lunch from the salad/hot bar and grabbed a few snacks for the drive. After enjoying our meal, we continued our drive east.

Past Paia, Twin Falls is one of the first stops, and one of the most popular. We got out and admired the falls and bamboo planted in the area.

Our next stop was [Garden of Eden](https://mauigardenofeden.com). This place was beautiful and highly recommended for any botanical garden fans. We started with coconut flavored ice coffees at the Garden Cafe. They were surprisingly tasty.
- Duck pond with aggressive ducks.
- Bamboo alley.
- The waterfall overlook.
- Closed the place down.

From there we continued the drive, slowing down to take in the views of the ocean and numerous waterfalls. Navigating the road took quite a bit of focus too as the 50+ yields near single lane bridges or construction zones often did not provide enough site line to see oncoming traffic.
- More comments about the drive.

As we got closer to Hana, we were surprised to come upon [Hana Farms](https://www.hanafarms.com/). Fortunately the grill was open on Friday nights. Stacy and I both got the Kalua Pork Plate. Everything on the plate was delicious. We also picked up some fresh banana bread from the market.

After a wild drive and some great food, we got to our [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18039677). Time to sleep to get ready for the next day's adventures.
