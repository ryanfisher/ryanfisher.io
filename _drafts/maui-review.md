## Maui Review

### Day one - Road to Hana
Our flight landed about noon. We headed to the rental car center to pick up our convertible camaro, the recommended car for the Road to Hana. From there we immediately headed towards Hana.

Our first stop was [Mana Foods](https://manafoodsmaui.com), a wonderful independent grocery store in Paia. We picked up lunch from the salad/hot bar and grabbed a few snacks for the drive. After enjoying our meal, we continued our drive east.

Past Paia, Twin Falls is one of the first stops, and one of the most popular. We got out and admired the falls and bamboo planted in the area.

Our next stop was [Garden of Eden](https://mauigardenofeden.com). This place was beautiful and highly recommended for any botanical garden fans. We started with coconut flavored ice coffees at the Garden Cafe. They were surprisingly tasty.
- Duck pond with aggressive ducks.
- Bamboo alley.
- The waterfall overlook.
- Closed the place down.

From there we continued the drive, slowing down to take in the views of the ocean and numerous waterfalls. Navigating the road took quite a bit of focus too as the 50+ yields near single lane bridges or construction zones often did not provide enough site line to see oncoming traffic.

As we got closer to Hana, we were surprised to come upon [Hana Farms](https://www.hanafarms.com/). Fortunately the grill was open on Friday nights. Stacy and I both got the Kalua Pork Plate. Everything on the plate was delicious. We also picked up some fresh banana bread from the market.

After a wild drive and some great food, we got to our [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18039677). Time to sleep to get ready for the next day's adventures.

### Day two - Back Road from Hana
After enjoying our Hana Farms banana bread, we headed to Hasegawa General Store. It looked like the place had everything. We just needed water and coffee.

Pipiwai Trail in Haleakala National Park was one of our main destinations on our Road to Hana itinerary. It did not disappoint. Much of the length of the trail is bamboo forest. Walking through the towering bamboo as wind gently rustled the leaves and knocked the culms into each other, sounding like a forest sized wind chime, was a surreal experience. The trail ends at the mesmerizing Waimoku Falls which we enjoyed for a while before returning back through the bamboo.

Once back at the trailhead, we had a decision to make. Most people return from Hana the same way they came. However, there's an alternative route along the southern coast of Maui - the back road to Hana. It's a different experience - isolated and far drier than the jungle on the main road. We spoke to a ranger at the trailhead who warned us of an 8 mile section of the road that is either unpaved or riddled with potholes. It still sounded like the better choice and it was one of the best decisions we made. The road wasn't nearly as bad as some made it sound and the lighter traffic made the single lane sections far easier to navigate than on the more crowded main road.

We eventually found our way back to civilization where we made a stop in Kula at Grandma's Coffee House. The coffee was just what we needed for our final stretch of drive to Wailea. The baked goods looked amazing too but we didn't want to spoil our appetites.

Just before getting to Hotel Wailea, we made a stop in Kihei at [Ululani's Hawaiian Shave Ice](https://www.ululanishawaiianshaveice.com), a perfect refreshment for the heat.
