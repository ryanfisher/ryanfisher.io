title: Choosing Solar Power in San Diego
---

## Why?
Hot months and working from home full-time has driven our electric costs up quickly.

## Considerations
- Cost - Ultimately we want to know how much we'll save by moving to solar power. We'll be spending more time at home. Summers are expected to get hotter or at least stay hot for longer. Growing kids and software development full-time from my home office will all likely contribute to growing electricity costs.
- Risk

## The Candidates
I reached out to a few different providers for quotes after scouring reviews and talking with friends around the neighborhood.
