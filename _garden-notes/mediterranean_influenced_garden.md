The Upper Backyard (Mediterranean Influenced Garden)
====================================================

The upper backyard is the sunniest part of the garden. It's also the largest area. For these reasons you'll find most of our fruit trees and other edibles here. Given the climate, the focus is on plants that do well in Mediterranean gardens.
